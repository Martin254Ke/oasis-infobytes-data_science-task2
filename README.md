# **Car Price Prediction using Machine Learning**
This project leverages machine learning regression techniques to predict car selling prices based on key features such as the car's brand, year of manufacture, mileage, and more.
It is designed to showcase data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

# **ðŸ“‹ Project Overview**
The price of a car depends on numerous factors like brand goodwill, features, horsepower, mileage, and more. 
This project aims to build a regression model to predict car prices accurately. 
The steps involve:
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
Feature Engineering
Training Regression Models
Evaluating Model Performance
Visualization of Results

#**ðŸš€ Key Features**

Data preprocessing, including handling categorical variables and missing data.
Implementation of Linear Regression for predictive modeling.
Model evaluation using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and RÂ² Score.
Visualization of actual vs. predicted prices.

#**ðŸ“‚ Dataset**
The dataset used in this project contains the following key features:
Car_Name: Name of the car.
Year: Year of manufacture.
Present_Price: Current market price.
Selling_Price: Target variable (price at which the car is being sold).
Driven_kms: Kilometers the car has been driven.
Fuel_Type: Type of fuel used (Petrol/Diesel/CNG).
Transmission: Type of transmission (Manual/Automatic).
Owner: Number of previous owners.

#**ðŸ§ª Workflow**
Load and Explore Data: Inspect and understand the dataset.
Data Cleaning: Handle missing values and encode categorical variables.
Train-Test Split: Split data into training and testing sets.
Model Training: Train a Linear Regression model.
Evaluation: Use performance metrics to assess the model's accuracy.
Visualization: Plot actual vs. predicted prices for validation.

#**ðŸ§® Results**
Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 1.22
Mean Squared Error (MSE): 3.53
RÂ² Score: 0.85
